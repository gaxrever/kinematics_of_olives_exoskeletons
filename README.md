# kinematics_of_olives_exoskeletons
Kimematic evaluation of the architectures discussed in the paper : "Exoskeletons for olives harvest on rugged terrains"
The format is Matlab live script. 
For every architecture the mathematical modeling of the foreward kinematics and the gravity compensation is performed.
The symbolic Jacobian matrix and the joint torques are described.
